### Background
As iGEM requires, Software teams should create a novel software tool that supports some aspect of synthetic biology. Since recent years our team were committed to software development which may contribute little to synthetic biology or relating works, we want to develop something more "biology" this year. 

After talking with our PI, we learned about Flux balance analysis (FBA). FBA  is a method for analyzing the flow of metabolites through a metabolic network. FBA can calculate the flow of it and make it possible to "foresee" the growth rate of an organism or a biotechnologically significant metabolite. 

### Inspiration
iGEMers and biological factories frequently complain it repeated and troublesome to improve a genetic circuit and implement genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions when they dissatisfy the productivity of the organism, as we investigated. Factories regularly do such work simply based on experience or maybe just by random attempt. Labs may use some mathematical methods. Just as mentioned, the FBA and its further study have been proved useful in physiological studies, gap-filling efforts and genome-scale synthetic biology. However, using such methods doesn't mean that failure would not occur, and plenty of experiments, namely, plenty waste of time may still be demanded. For sure, there are several software that are made for such modeling, yet they do have several defects. Meanwhile, considering that both factories and iGEMers may specialize in biology but be quite unfamiliar with computer software, those command-prompt-only software are not perfect.

Obviously, current tools cannot satisfy the need. Thus, here comes "ForeSyn", the software born to solve the problem.

### Project (What's ForeSyn)

Foresyn is a user-friendly platform that was designed specifically for synthetic biologists to solve such issues above. Just like its name, Foresyn can foresee the targeted improvements to the users' experiment, give advise and therefore increase productivity, literally by the neoteric workflow management based on our customized database.

By using our software, labs and factories can alter the bounds on certain reactions to simulate the growth on different media or of bacteria with multiple gene knockouts.  Despite this, users can select their own object function, and our software can output the optimal solution of it. 

Of course, users don't need to recite so many command codes. All you need may be a single mouse. Moreover, our software performs a better user experience by presenting supreme graphical result display.

Through this things, Foresyn can literally predict, I mean, foresee the likely result or trend of an experiment conducted by a synthetic biologist. Particularly, what it sees immediately transforms into what you see.

### Slogan (maybe?)

Foresyn has foreseen the experiments, that helps synthetic biologists see further.

Foresyn foresees the synthetic biological experiments, and makes you see further.
