# Collaborations

## With University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)

他们提供数据给我们，我们根据他们的数据进行了分析，并且构造了biobricks反馈给他们。

Since our project is based on the database, our project's first step is to collect data from multiple databases. From the very beginning, we took a look on the results of IGEM competition in 2018. Luckily, we found that the UESTC team had already done the work of collecting data from various databases to build their project, BioMaster. Our team quickly contacted with the UESTC team to ask if we could make good use of the data. They satisfied our request without hesitation. After getting their data, we build our project on it. Through the way of developing the project, we also contributed our biobricks to their project which they might need. Their project was updated as well.

## With Sun Yat-Sen University(SYSU)

In June, we visited SYSU and had a meeting with their iGEM team members. We communicated with our team projects and gave helpful suggestions to each other. They offered us useful advice on accuracy issues in our project and helped us to fixed them. We asked them some questions related to their project and helped them to clarify the experiment design. Moreover, we helped them to accelerate their experiment by giving the data they needed.

## With Shandong University(SDU)

We also helped a girl from the SDU who had trouble in creating animation by software.
