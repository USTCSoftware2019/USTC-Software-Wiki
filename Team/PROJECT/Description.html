          <h3>Background</h3>
          <div class="passage">As iGEM requires, Software teams should create a novel software tool that supports some
            aspect of synthetic biology. Since recent years our team were committed to software development which may
            contribute little to synthetic biology or relating works, we want to develop something more "biology" this
            year.
            <br>
            After talking with our PI, we learned about Flux balance analysis (FBA). FBA is a method for analyzing the
            flow of metabolites through a metabolic network. FBA can calculate the flow of it and make it possible to
            "foresee" the growth rate of an organism or a biotechnologically significant metabolite.
          </div>
          <h3>Inspiration</h3>
          <div class="passage">iGEMers and biological factories frequently complain it repeated and troublesome to
            improve a genetic circuit and implement genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions when they dissatisfy
            the productivity of the organism, as we investigated. Factories regularly do such work simply based on
            experience or maybe just by random attempt. Labs may use some mathematical methods. Just as mentioned, the
            FBA and its further study have been proved useful in physiological studies, gap-filling efforts and
            genome-scale synthetic biology. However, using such methods doesn't mean that failure would not occur, and
            plenty of experiments, namely, plenty waste of time may still be demanded. For sure, there are several
            software that are made for such modeling, yet they do have several defects. Meanwhile, considering that both
            factories and iGEMers may specialize in biology but be quite unfamiliar with computer software, those
            command-prompt-only software are not perfect.
            <br>
            Obviously, current tools cannot satisfy the need. Thus, here comes "ForeSyn", the software born to solve the
            problem.
          </div>
          <h3>What's ForeSyn</h3>
          <div class="passage">
            Foresyn is a user-friendly platform that was designed specifically for synthetic biologists to solve such
            issues above. Just like its name, Foresyn can foresee the targeted improvements to the users' experiment,
            give advise and therefore increase productivity, literally by the neoteric workflow management based on our
            customized database.
            <br>
            By using our software, labs and factories can alter the bounds on certain reactions to simulate the growth
            on different media or of bacteria with multiple gene knockouts. Despite this, users can select their own
            object function, and our software can output the optimal solution of it.
            <br>
            Of course, users don't need to recite so many command codes. All you need may be a single mouse. Moreover,
            our software performs a better user experience by presenting supreme graphical result display.
            <br>
            Through this things, Foresyn can literally predict, I mean, foresee the likely result or trend of an
            experiment conducted by a synthetic biologist. Particularly, what it sees immediately transforms into what
            you see.

          </div>
          <h3>Why choose Foresyn</h3>
          <div class="passage">
            <h4>Lessen Your Needless Works</h4>
            <h4>What You See Is What You Get</h4>
            <h4>No Command Prompt Using Need</h4>
            <h4>Comprehensive Customized Database</h4>
