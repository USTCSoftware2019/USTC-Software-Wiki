          <h3>Lessons</h3>
          <div class="passage">
            Starting from this year, our university opened an optional course about Synthetic Biology.
            We invited several professors from other universities, which includes SJTU, Fudan University
            and SUSTech. We have learned the necessary knowledge and come up with some ideas about our project. It is at
            that time we started our brainstorm. Then we go to the lab that another team in our university works and
            learn how to experiment with synthetic biology. Thanks to their help, we determined our project on July
            10th.
