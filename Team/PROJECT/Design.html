            <h3>Principles</h3>
            <h4>Balance</h4>
            <div class="passage">
              When we are developing Foresyn, we discovered that there is a contradiction between speed and accuracy. So
              our strategy is to use slow but accurate algorithm when searching small datasets, and use fast but less
              accurate algorithm when searching large ones.
            </div>
            <h4>User-friendly</h4>
            <div class="passage">
              To be easily used by users who do not know command line thingy, we designed a high-level framework to
              lessen the needless works while building models. Also, our databases have been customized with biological
              logic.

            <div class="passage">
              The user can easily see the model built, edit owned model with a concise interface, and get a clear
              overview of the analysis output with the graph generated by our software.

            <h4>Being A Platform</h4>
            <div class="passage">
              After building customized model and getting the output of analysis, user can easily share it to others
              with the unique codes generated to represent the very model. In the page of one model, others can comment,
              rank, and also add it to his favorites.

            <h4>Lasting Support</h4>
            <div class="passage">
              Other than the teams who close their service after the competition, we had decided to offer a lasting
              support with the cloud server rented for a long time.
            </div>
            <h4>Split Computing Process</h4>
            <div class="passage">
              Our website requires computing large models, and it is quite embarrassing to see users waiting for
              browsers for so long, so we use message queues to maintain computing tasks.
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="passage">
              We split our programs computing models from our website and use message queues to send and receive
              information about our computation. A queue is a data structure that stores things waiting to be handled,
              and it obeys the "First Come, First Serve" principle. So, we can store our computing tasks in the queue,
              and response to users instantly about the progress of his tasks.

            <h3>Iterations</h3>
            <div class="passage">
              The iterations of our project were linked closely with our Human Practice works. As we showed clearly in
              the page of our HP work, our project has been modified and improved again and again. The whole process is
              as follows:
            </div>
            <h4>Preliminary product design</h4>
            <div class="passage">
              After the visit to Huaheng Biotech and acknowledging the problems faced in the real world, we went to have
              a meeting with our PI, professor Jiong Hong, who informed us about the existence of FBA. Then we had some
              investigation about FBA, only to find that all existing tools at that time lack the ease of use despite
              the beauty of its method. It first came into our mind to build a great FBA tool that meets the
              requirements of real production environments.
              <br><br>
              We proposed a revolutionary work flow that would greatly improve efficiency and decrease the complexity of
              using. In other words, we designed a high-level framework to automatically solve many inner logics and
              thus simplify the process of analysis.
              <br><br>
              We first considered to support a wild and customized searching function based on the optimization of
              databases. After a job done by UESTC-Software in 2018, we wanted to do some upgrade of the scale and the
              usability of databases, so we did some investigations and documented the defects found in the existing
              tools.

            </div>
            <h4>Mid-term: A Change of Emphasis</h4>
            <div class="passage">
              However, our idea hadn’t been fully approved by the SYSU team and their professor. In the meetup with SYSU
              team in Guangzhou, China, we introduced our projects to each other. At that time, we devoted ourselves to
              optimize our database which was at a great scale and then linking the output to FBA’s input. They put
              forward that out idea about optimizing massive databases was not targeted for Synthetic Biology. In other
              words, there was a bias in our aim, for the work done to optimize the databases will distract us to design
              FBA workflow and its efficiency.
              <br><br>
              Also, Yonghao Liang, a senior iGEMer of USTC, raised a question that whether we can provide a
              recommendation of Biobricks when the user end up building his models. For example, if modifications and
              analysis had been done to the user's model based on E. coli, the researcher can immediately be
              acknowledged by our system which Biobricks he or she can use. After more discussion, we found it would be
              a useful function, so we decided to append our system with a micro recommendation system for proper
              Biobricks.

              CCic, which stands for the Conference of China iGEMer Community, is the biggest synthetic biology
              conference in China. This year we had a wonderful time there in Shenzhen. We did presentations and our
              idea was evaluated by many experts and lovers in the field of synthetic biology. There we were encouraged
              to expand our project to a platform, using which users can share their models, see the history of
              modifying, and comment on the model pages. It enriched our project, made it closer to a mature one.

            <div class="passage">
              COBRA methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and
              eukaryotes. cobrapy is a constraint-based modeling package that is designed to accommodate the biological
              complexity of the next generation of COBRA models and provides access to commonly used COBRA methods, such
              as flux balance analysis, flux variability analysis, and gene deletion analyses.

              Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed,
