          <p>
            We intend to engineer E. coli DH5a to be the A. hydrophila killer. Our project can be fulfilled by three
            devices: 1). a sensor which can detect the presence of A. hydrophila in fish excrement and express green
            fluorescence protein. After farmers use fluorescence detector (only cost 60 RMB) to check the feces sample,
            they can deduce the amount of A. hydrophila in a fish body and take actions to avoid the outbreak of
            infection. 2). a primary helper killer which can express quorum quenching enzymes and reduce the virulence
            of A. hydrophila. 3). a secondary killer which expresses and releases antimicrobial peptides that can kill
            A. hydrophila directly. Thus, there are three kinds of killers with each device. The killers are put
            together into capsules and are mixed with fish fodder. After fish eat the capsules, the engineered E. coli
            can be released in its intestine, which is the organ A.
            hydrophila firstly invades and multiplies during infection.
