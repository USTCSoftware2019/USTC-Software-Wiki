            Innovative educational tools and public engagement activities have the ability to discuss the science behind synthetic biology, 
            spark new scientific curiosity and establish a public dialogue about synthetic biology from voices and views outside the lab.

            At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. 
            “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams’ efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and the work affects the world. 
            Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is 
            responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability 
            of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design and execution.
