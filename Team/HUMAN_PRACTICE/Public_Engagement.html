          <h4>iSTC-interesting Synthetic Transaction and Cooperation</h4>
          <div class="passage">
            In order to promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, 
            our team is devoted to the development of a board game which aims at instructing non-biologists to understand 
            what biobricks can do and how can we use them to make new things.
            <br>
            As games have become a signiﬁcant part of our spare time, and most youngsters would rather play games to have fun. 
            We consider it a perfect opportunity to introduce synthetic biology to them.
            <br>
            To attract more people without such background to be interested in this area, we develop this board game specially 
            designed for synthetic biology. In this game, even laymen can have fun. We greatly weakened the hardcore and 
            annoying part of synthetic biology when we keep the main idea of it.

          <h4>USTC1958 Café</h4>
          <div class="passage">
            In our broader community, there's a café called USTC1958, which is the highest rating café in Hefei, 
            according to the internet. We consider it a great way to interact with them. They may add color to our project while we can add new elements for them. 
            <br>
            Talking with the café owner, she spoke highly of our projects and enthusiasm, and also showed great interest in 
            synthetic biology. As an attractive café owner, she provided brilliant suggestions for our team name, logo, and 
            uniform. Since we don't have a teammate in the art relating majors, their advice had a great inﬂuence on us. 
            <br>
            Meanwhile, we gave an overview of synthetic biology to them. They were interested in it and willing to add some 
            "synthetic" elements in the café. We oﬀered to rendered our board game, which may help the customer kill time 
            and subtly teach them some aspects of synthetic biology. Thus we can make complex scientiﬁc information ﬂow into the community. 
            <br>
            It's really marvelous that more and more people will start learning with games and coﬀee.
