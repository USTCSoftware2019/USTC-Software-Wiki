          <h3>UESTC</h3>
          <div class="passage">Since our project is based on the database, our project's first step is to collect data
            from multiple databases. From the very beginning, we took a look on the results of IGEM competition in 2018.
            Luckily, we found that the UESTC team had already done the work of collecting data from various databases to
            build their project, BioMaster. <br>
            <div class="text-center psgImg">
              <img src="../../File/T--USTC-Software--colla_biomaster.png" alt="">
            </div>
            Our team quickly contacted with the UESTC team to ask if we could make good
            use of the data. They satisfied our request without hesitation. After getting their data, we build our
            project on it. Through the way of developing the project, we also contributed our biobricks to their project
            which they might need. Their project was updated as well. During the process of our communication, both of our
            project were upgraded.

          <h3>SYSU</h3>
          <div class="passage">In June, we visited SYSU and had a meeting with their iGEM team members. We communicated
            with our team projects and gave helpful suggestions to each other. They offered us useful advice on accuracy
            issues in our project and helped us to fixed them. We asked them some questions related to their project and
            helped them to clarify the experiment design. Moreover, we helped them to accelerate their experiment by
            giving the data they needed.

          <h3>SDU</h3>
          <div class="passage">We also helped a girl from the SDU who had trouble in creating animation by software
            during the time when we attended the CCIC meeting.
            <br>
          </div>
          <h3>USTC</h3>
          <div class="passage">
            Our team, together with the USTC team, has conducted an experimental training in the lab, which aims at
            helping more students to use our tools effectively and efficiently.
            <br>
            What's more, Pengcen Jiang, a member form the USTC team, has helped us how to use cobra tools and gave us
            a lot of suggestions on how to convert our data into practical meaning.
            <br>
            After having built our project, we invites the USTC team to test our tools. They gave us much advice on how to
            upgrade our project. Thanks for their feedback.
