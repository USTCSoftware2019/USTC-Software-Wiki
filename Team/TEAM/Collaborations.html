          <h3>UESTC</h3>
          <div class="passage">
            Since our project is based on the database, our project's first step is to collect data
            from multiple databases. From the very beginning, we took a look on the results of IGEM competition in 2018.
            Luckily, we found that the UESTC team had already done the work of collecting data from various databases to
            build their project, BioMaster. <br>
            <div class="text-center psgImg">
              <img alt="" src="../../File/T--USTC-Software--colla_biomaster.png">
              <p>Figure 1: UESTC biomaster</p>
            </div>
            Our team quickly contacted with the UESTC team to ask if we could make good
            use of the data. They satisfied our request without hesitation. After getting their data, we build our
            project on it. Through the way of developing the project, we also contributed our biobricks to their project
            which they might need. Their project was updated as well. During the process of our communication, both of our project were upgraded.

          <h3>SYSU</h3>
          <div class="passage">In June, we visited SYSU and had a meeting with their iGEM team members. We communicated
            with our team projects and gave helpful suggestions to each other. They offered us useful advice on accuracy
            issues in our project and helped us to fixed them. We asked them some questions related to their project and
            helped them to clarify the experiment design. Moreover, we helped them to accelerate their experiment by
            giving the data they needed.

          <h3>SDU</h3>
          <div class="passage">We also helped a girl from the SDU who had trouble in creating animation by software
            during the time when we attended the CCIC meeting.
            <br>
          </div>
          <h3>USTC</h3>
          <div class="passage">
            The USTC team is the other team of our school, which focuses on biology, and most of their members majored
            in biology. Therefore, we communicate a lot throughout the whole project.
            <br>
            <div class="psgImg">
              <img alt="" src="../../File/T--USTC-Software--colla_ustc1.jpg">
              <p>Figure 4: Having a meeting with USTC team</p>
            </div>
            Our team, together with the USTC team, has conducted a 4-day experimental training in the lab, which aims at
            helping more students to use our tools effectively and efficiently. Although most of our software team
            members majored in computer science, we know more clearly about how the basic experiment is conducted and
            what we can do to help synthetic biology researchers to improve their working efficiency through the process
            of doing biology experiments.

            </div>
            <br>
            What's more, Pengcen Jiang, a member form the USTC team, has helped us how to use cobra tools and gave us a
            lot of suggestions on how to convert our data into practical meaning.
            <br>
            <br>
            After having built our project, we invite the USTC team to test our tools. They give us a lot of advice on
            how to upgrade our project. Thanks for their feedback.
