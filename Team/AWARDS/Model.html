          <p>Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function
            and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline,
            and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design
            before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer
            before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use
            it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

          <p>Aeromonas Hydrophila is a gram-negative bacterium which exists ubiquitously in water ponds.
            It is an opportunistic pathogen which can cause many diseases in fish and create a large amount
            of economic loss in aquaculture. The symptoms of the diseases caused by A. hydrophila infection include
            ulcers, fin rot, and hemorrhagic septicaemia. When A. hydrophila enters into fish body, it often
            colonizes the gastrointestinal tract first. The virulence factors of A. hydrophila include its
            enterotoxins, hemolysin, and proteases produced by Type II and Type III secretion system. (Citterio)
