          <p>Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to
            move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these
            software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams.
            Without necessarily being big or complex,
            they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find
            and honor such "nuggets" of computational work.

          <p>Aeromonas Hydrophila is a gram-negative bacterium which exists ubiquitously in water ponds.
            It is an opportunistic pathogen which can cause many diseases in fish and create a large amount
            of economic loss in aquaculture. The symptoms of the diseases caused by A. hydrophila infection include
            ulcers, fin rot, and hemorrhagic septicaemia. When A. hydrophila enters into fish body, it often
            colonizes the gastrointestinal tract first. The virulence factors of A. hydrophila include its
            enterotoxins, hemolysin, and proteases produced by Type II and Type III secretion system. (Citterio)
